# Adrian Szmajewski | Interactive Business Website

![ResponsivePreview](readme/project2.gif)

## 🎯 Introduction

Welcome to my interactive business-themed website! 🚀 This project goes beyond static design by integrating **JavaScript** functionality alongside **HTML**, **CSS**, and libraries such as **Bootstrap**, **Google Maps API**, and **EmailJS** for dynamic features.

The website represents a modern, responsive business landing page with real-time interactions such as working contact forms, location mapping, and enhanced UI components. It's designed to simulate a functional business presence and demonstrate front-end development capabilities in action.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Demonstrate Interactive Web Features**  
  This project aims to highlight the use of JavaScript to bring interactivity to a modern website, including functional forms, API integrations, and dynamic UI behavior.

- **Practice Integration of External Services**  
  By using tools like Google Maps and EmailJS, I focused on learning how to incorporate third-party libraries and services into a front-end-only website.

- **Improve Front-End Design with Frameworks**  
  The site uses **Bootstrap** to streamline layout and responsiveness, ensuring the interface remains clean and adaptive across devices.

- **Simulate a Business Landing Page**  
  The project emulates a typical company website structure — with a home, about, services, contact, and location — ideal for client presentation or portfolio purposes.

- **Strengthen UI/UX Skills**  
  From smooth navigation to interactive elements, this project helps sharpen design sensibility while improving code organization and responsiveness.
