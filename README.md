# Adrian Szmajewski | Interactive Business Website

![ResponsivePreview](readme/project2.gif)

## 🎯 Introduction

Welcome to my interactive business-themed website! 🚀 This project goes beyond static design by integrating **JavaScript** functionality alongside **HTML**, **CSS**, and libraries such as **Bootstrap**, **Google Maps API**, and **EmailJS** for dynamic features.

The website represents a modern, responsive business landing page with real-time interactions such as working contact forms, location mapping, and enhanced UI components. It's designed to simulate a functional business presence and demonstrate front-end development capabilities in action.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Demonstrate Interactive Web Features**  
  This project aims to highlight the use of JavaScript to bring interactivity to a modern website, including functional forms, API integrations, and dynamic UI behavior.

- **Practice Integration of External Services**  
  By using tools like Google Maps and EmailJS, I focused on learning how to incorporate third-party libraries and services into a front-end-only website.

- **Improve Front-End Design with Frameworks**  
  The site uses **Bootstrap** to streamline layout and responsiveness, ensuring the interface remains clean and adaptive across devices.

- **Simulate a Business Landing Page**  
  The project emulates a typical company website structure — with a home, about, services, contact, and location — ideal for client presentation or portfolio purposes.

- **Strengthen UI/UX Skills**  
  From smooth navigation to interactive elements, this project helps sharpen design sensibility while improving code organization and responsiveness.

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:  
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.  
   - Click on **Settings**.  
   - From the left-hand menu, select **Pages**.  
   - Under **Source**, choose the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder.  
   - Click **Save**.

3. **Access your live website**:  
   After a few seconds, GitHub will generate a public URL for your website. It typically looks like:

   ```
   Example:  
   ```
   https://adrian77792.github.io/Project2/
